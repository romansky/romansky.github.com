### My blogging "Hello World" ###

The great "internets" have blessed me with vast amounts of information, over time I have used this information and got better, advanced in my career etc..
So it seems that this relationship has been one way for the most part, and now is my turn to "chew" information for web new-comers that fancy to learn, what I am already doing proficiently.

Thus, my humble plan for 2012 (which might be the last year for planet earth - according to some old chicks) is...:
- (code related) blog post every week (or two)
- new open source project every month (or two)


	For Fame & Web-Scale!
